    'Crossmint Wallet Agent — a Solana-native crypto agent with an auto-provisioned smart wallet powered by Crossmint.

This agent can:
• Check SOL and SPL token balances on Solana
• Transfer tokens to any Solana recipient address
• Review transaction history and check transaction status
• Monitor wallet spending policy and capabilities
• Operate without native SOL for gas — gas is sponsored by Crossmint''s paymaster
• EVM chain support (Base, Ethereum, Polygon) also available

The wallet is automatically created when you hire this agent — no setup or private keys to manage. The server holds a Crossmint API key and server signer that manages the wallet on the agent''s behalf.

Perfect for:
• Managing Solana treasury operations
• Automating SPL token distributions and payments
• Monitoring Solana portfolio balances
• Executing approved transfers on Solana

⚠️ Always review transfer details before confirming. The agent will ask for confirmation before executing any transfer.',
