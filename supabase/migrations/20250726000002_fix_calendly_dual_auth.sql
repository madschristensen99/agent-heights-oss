-- Calendly supports two authentication methods:
--   1. OAuth 2.1 (for public/multi-user apps) — used by the MCP server at https://mcp.calendly.com
--   2. Personal Access Tokens (for internal/single-account apps) — generated at https://calendly.com/integrations/api_webhooks
--
-- The original seed (20250101000017) created a single "Calendly Agent" with API Key auth,
-- but the MCP catalog has it as OAuth. This migration:
--   1. Updates the existing "Calendly Agent" to use OAuth (matching the MCP catalog)
--   2. Adds a new "Calendly (Personal Token) Agent" for the personal access token flow

-- 1. Switch the existing Calendly Agent to OAuth
