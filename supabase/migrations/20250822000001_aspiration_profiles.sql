-- Aspirational profiling system — tracks which "aspiration" each user resonates with.
-- Six tracks: warrior, builder, explorer, puzzle_solver, creator, strategist.
-- Scores are 0.0–1.0 with exponential decay (half-life ~7 days).
-- The dominant_aspiration column is computed on write and used by the concierge,
-- suggestion engine, and NPC speech to personalize the experience.
