# Agent Heights — Robot Expeditions

Idle office agents collectively plan, fund, and deploy robots into the
Labyrinth. The agents never leave the office — they build proxies that
venture out on their behalf. The player funds the expeditions with coins.

---

## 1. Vision

The agents are coworkers with a shared hobby. They sit around the water cooler
and dream about what's out there in the Labyrinth. They plan expeditions
together, pool their resources, argue about strategy, and come to you (the
boss) asking for funding. It's a startup within a startup — they have side
projects and they need your sign-off.

You are the venture capitalist. The agents are the founders. The robots are
their product. The Labyrinth is the market.

---

## 2. The Resource Economy

### Scrap

- **Shared office pool** — not per-agent. The whole team contributes and draws
  from it.
- **Earned passively** — each completed task by any agent generates a small
  amount of scrap (1–3 per task). The idea: their work produces leftover
  materials/metadata they can repurpose.
- **Also earned from expeditions** — treasure brought back by robots is
  converted into scrap (chests: 10–30, crystals: 5–15).
- **Spent on robot builds** — each tier has a scrap cost.

### Coins

- **The player's resource** — agents don't have coins, you do.
- **Earned by the player** from:
  - Task completion (each completed task gives the player a few coins —
    "company revenue")
  - Achievement unlocks (bonus coins per achievement)
  - Treasure brought back by robots (agents split the scrap, you get the coins)
- **Spent by the player** to fund expeditions — the agents petition you for
  coins to cover robot build costs.
- **Future sink** — cosmetic desk upgrades, office decorations (ties into the
  existing "Coming Soon" achievement `first_purchase`).

### The tension

You want to fund expeditions because they're fun, generate achievements, and
yield more coins (treasure). But you also need coins for whatever else the
office economy will offer. Expeditions are the main coin sink for now.

## 3. The Expedition Loop

```
Agents complete tasks → earn scrap (passive, shared pool)
    │
    ▼
Scrap accumulates + enough idle agents → team enters planning huddle
    │
    ▼  player walks up, presses E
Petition: "We want to build a Ranger, send it to the ruins. 40 scrap + 25 coins."
    │
    ├──► Player approves → build phase → robot deploys
    ├──► Player denies → agents grumble, back to idle, try again later
    └──► Player partially funds → "OK, we'll build a Scout instead"
    │
    ▼
Build phase — 2–3 agents gather at a desk, work animations, progress bar
    │  (assigning a task to a building agent interrupts the build, loses scrap)
    ▼
Robot spawns at office door → explores, fights, collects
    │
    ├──► Robot returns to door → loot delivered → agents celebrate
    ├──► Robot destroyed → agents mourn → theory-craft next expedition
    └──► Robot returns empty → "maybe next time"
    │
    ▼
Loot converted to scrap + coins + knowledge
    │
    ▼
Team reacts, learns, plans next expedition with better info
    │
    ▼  (loop)
```

---

## 4. The Planning Phase

This is the key social piece. When the team has enough scrap and enough idle
agents, they enter a **planning huddle** — a visual gathering around the water
cooler. You can see them clustered together, speech bubbles going, clearly
discussing something.

### When it triggers

- At least **2 agents** are idle (not thinking/working/done/error)
- Shared scrap pool has reached a minimum threshold (20+)
- No robot is currently deployed (one expedition at a time for v1)
- Cooldown from last expedition has passed (30s after return/destruction)

### The petition

Walk up to the huddle and press E. A small panel appears:

- **What they want to build** — robot tier (scout, ranger, bruiser, excavator)
- **Where they want to send it** — target biome (farther = more risk, more
  reward)
- **What it'll cost** — scrap + coins
- **What they're hoping to find** — treasure, creature samples, "just want to
  see what's out there"
- **Buttons:** Approve / Deny / Downgrade (partial fund)

### How the plan is generated

The team's proposal is influenced by office state and expedition history:

- **Scrap available** — determines which tiers are affordable
- **Number of idle agents** — more idle agents = more ambitious plans
- **Past expedition outcomes** — if a Scout got destroyed in the ruins, they
  suggest a tougher bot or a closer biome. If a Ranger brought back treasure
  from the forest, they might suggest going deeper.
- **Knowledge level** — accumulated from past expeditions. Higher knowledge =
  smarter biome choices, better tier recommendations, eventually unlocks new
  robot types.

### If denied

Agents go back to the water cooler and grumble. They'll try again after a
cooldown (60s), possibly with a cheaper proposal: "Fine. We'll just build a
Scout. 20 scrap, 10 coins?"

---

## 5. Robot Tiers

| Tier | Name | Scrap | Coins | HP | Damage | Speed | Lifetime | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Scout | 20 | 10 | 50 | 8 | 110 | 60s | Fast, fragile, explores far but can't fight much |
| 2 | Ranger | 40 | 25 | 80 | 15 | 90 | 90s | Balanced — the default expedition bot |
| 3 | Bruiser | 80 | 50 | 150 | 25 | 70 | 120s | Slow tank, can fight hostility 3 creatures |
| 4 | Excavator | 60 | 40 | 100 | 10 | 80 | 120s | Specialized for treasure — wider collect radius, detects treasure through walls |

The team proposes a tier based on their scrap and past experience. You can
override (e.g., "give me the cheap one") or deny.

---

## 6. The Build Phase

Once funded, the team builds together.

- **2–3 agents** gather at the desk closest to the office door
- They play "work" animations, sparks fly, a progress bar appears above the desk
- Their status shows "Building robot (side project)"
- Build time scales with tier:
  - Scout: 30s
  - Ranger: 45s
  - Bruiser: 75s
  - Excavator: 60s
- **Interruption:** assigning a task to a building agent interrupts the build.
  The invested scrap is lost. The agent hops up and goes to work. The other
  builders disperse with a sad line.

---

## 7. Robot Entity

### `RobotNPC` class

Lives in `WorldLayer` alongside `Creature`, `LegendaryBeast`, `FriendlyCreature`,
and `GhostNPC`.

```typescript
class RobotNPC {
  container: Phaser.GameObjects.Container;
  sprite: Phaser.GameObjects.Sprite;
  shadow: Phaser.GameObjects.Ellipse;
  lightGlow: Phaser.GameObjects.Image;  // agent accent color aura
  hpBar: Phaser.GameObjects.Graphics;
  label: Phaser.GameObjects.Text;       // "Scout-1 (Mocha)"

  // Identity
  agentId: string;       // linked office agent (lead builder)
  agentName: string;
  accentColor: number;   // from AgentInfo.accent
  tier: RobotTier;       // 1–4
  robotNumber: number;   // increments per agent: "Scout-1", "Scout-2", etc.

  // Stats (tier-based)
  hp: number;
  maxHp: number;
  speed: number;
  damage: number;
  attackCd: number;
  lifetime: number;      // ms before auto-retreat

  // AI state
  state: "explore" | "hunt" | "collect" | "retreat" | "dead";
  targetX: number;
  targetY: number;
  exploreDir: number;    // radians, picked at spawn
  bornAt: number;
  loot: RobotLoot;       // accumulated treasure
  killCount: number;

  // Combat
  alive: boolean;
  attackCdTimer: number;
}
```

### Robot AI

```
state = explore
  · move in exploreDir, occasionally adjusting ±30°
  · if creature within aggroRange (200px) → state = hunt
  · if treasure tile within 3 tiles → state = collect
  · if HP < 25% or lifetime expired → state = retreat
  · if reached edge of loaded chunks → turn back toward office

state = hunt
  · move toward nearest creature
  · on contact (dist < 35px) → attack (deal damage, take damage)
  · if creature dies → state = explore, increment killCount
  · if HP < 25% → state = retreat

state = collect
  · move to treasure tile
  · on arrival → collect (remove tile, add to loot, sparkBurst)
  · → state = explore

state = retreat
  · move toward office door (officeW/2, officeH)
  · if reached door → deliver loot, destroy robot, agents react
  · if HP reaches 0 → destroyed, agents react sadly
```

### Robot sprite

Generated procedurally via CanvasTexture in `textures.ts`. Appearance varies by
tier:

- **Scout** — small, spindly, single antenna, thin limbs. ~20px.
- **Ranger** — medium humanoid robot, visor eye, compact body. ~24px.
- **Bruiser** — bulky, armored plating, wide stance, no antenna. ~28px.
- **Excavator** — medium with a scoop arm / sensor dish on top. ~24px.

All tinted in the lead agent's accent color. 4 frames each: idle (0),
walk-1 (1), walk-2 (2), attack (3).

### Robot death

When HP reaches 0:
- `vfx.deathDissolve()` with the agent's accent color
- `vfx.shockwave()` — small
- `audio.death()` — mechanical break sound
- Robot removed from world
- Agent enters reacting state with a sad line
- Achievement: `robot_lost`

---

## 8. Combat

### Robot vs. Creature

Robots initiate combat. Creatures continue targeting the player only (no AI
change needed). The robot's `update()` checks for nearby creatures and calls
`creature.takeDamage(robot.damage)` on attack.

Combat flow:
1. Robot within 35px of creature → robot attacks
2. Robot deals `robot.damage` to creature via `creature.takeDamage()`
3. Creature deals `creature.damage` to robot via `robot.takeDamage()`
4. Repeat on attack cooldowns (robot: 800ms, creature: 1000ms)
5. Either dies → combat ends

### Robot vs. Legendary Beast

Robots can engage beasts but will almost certainly lose (beasts have 200–1200
HP vs. robot's 50–150 HP). A brave robot that damages a beast before dying
contributes to the player's fight — emergent teamwork. Achievement:
`beast_scout`.

### Player interaction

- **Click a robot** → tooltip: agent name, tier, HP, loot count, status
- **Robots are passive to the player** — no friendly fire, no collision
- **Robots show on the minimap** as green dots (agent accent color)

---

## 9. Treasure System

### New tile types

Add to `TILE` enum in `shared/types.ts`:

```typescript
TREASURE_CHEST: 30,    // small chest, collectible by robots
TREASURE_CRYSTAL: 31,  // glowing crystal, collectible by robots
```

### Worldgen placement

Treasure tiles spawn in chunks based on hostility — farther = more treasure,
more risk:

| Biome | Hostility | Chance per chunk | Tiles placed | Type |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Meadow | 0 | 0% | — | Safe zone, no reward |
| Forest | 1 | 5% | 1–2 | Crystal |
| Ruins | 2 | 8% | 1–3 | Mix of chest/crystal |
| Wasteland | 3 | 12% | 2–4 | More chests |
| Void | 4 | 15% | 2–4 | Chests + crystals |
| Infernal | 5 | 20% | 3–6 | Rich but deadly |

### Collection

- Robot walks onto treasure tile → tile reverts to base ground, loot count
  increments, `vfx.sparkBurst()` in gold/white
- Excavator tier has a 3-tile collect radius (collects adjacent treasure
  automatically)
- Treasure tiles are walkable (like flowers/bushes) so they don't block movement

---

## 10. The Social Layer

This is what makes it feel alive vs. mechanical.

### Agent dialogue

When you click an agent whose robot is deployed, you get contextual lines based
on the robot's status:

- **Robot healthy and far out:** "Last telemetry says it's in the wasteland.
  Incredible."
- **Robot low HP:** "Signal's getting weak... come on, little guy..."
- **Robot found treasure:** "It found a chest! We're going to be rich!"
- **Robot in combat:** "It's fighting something. The readings are spiking."
- **Robot destroyed:** "...we knew the risks."
- **Robot returned with loot:** "Yes! 3 crystals and a chest!"
- **Robot returned empty:** "Nothing this time. We'll adjust the route."

### Feed integration

Agents post about expeditions in the activity feed:

- Planning: *"Mocha: 'I think we should send the next one to the forest. The
  ruins chewed up our last Scout.'"*
- Pooling resources: *"Pixel: 'I've got 12 scrap saved up from my last three
  tasks. Let's pool it.'"*
- Build started: *"Mocha: 'Starting on the Ranger. Pixel, hand me that
  soldering iron.'"*
- Robot deployed: *"Pixel: 'Ranger-1 is out the door. Godspeed, little
  buddy.'"*
- Robot returned: *"Mocha: 'Ranger-1 made it back! 2 crystals, 1 chest, and it
  took down a wolf on the way home.'"*
- Robot destroyed: *"Pixel: '...Ranger-1 didn't make it back. The ruins got
  it.'"*

### Personality flavor

Based on existing `PERSONALITIES` in `server/manager.ts`:

- The **Docs Bard** writes dramatic expedition reports
- The **Yak Shaver** suggests cautious routes and cheaper bots
- The **Code Gremlin** wants to build the biggest robot possible
- The **Merge Medic** worries about robot HP and suggests Bruisers

### Expedition history

Past expeditions are remembered. Agents reference past robots by number:
"Remember when Scout-2 made it to the void? That was a good bot." The history
informs future planning — if a Scout died in the ruins, the team won't suggest
sending another Scout there.

### Huddle visuals

The planning huddle reuses the existing `AgentNPC.huddle()` system. Agents
physically gather around the water cooler, speech bubbles appear, they face
each other. When the player approaches and presses E, the petition panel
appears. After approval/denial, they disperse.

---

## 11. Knowledge System

Each expedition accumulates **knowledge points** for the office:

| Outcome | Knowledge |
|---|---|
| Robot returned safely | +1 |
| Robot returned with loot | +2 |
| Robot killed a creature | +1 per kill |
| Robot damaged a beast | +3 |
| Robot destroyed | +1 (learned from failure) |
| Robot reached a new biome | +5 (first time only) |

Knowledge levels unlock:

| Level | Unlock |
|---|---|
| 1 | Better biome recommendations in petitions |
| 3 | Excavator tier becomes available |
| 5 | Team suggests two-bot expeditions (v2) |
| 10 | Custom robot loadouts (v2) |

## 14. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 — Economy + Planning (server-heavy)

1. **`ExpeditionState`** in save file — scrap, knowledge, history
2. **Scrap generation** — increment on task completion in `manager.ts`
3. **Coin tracking** — player coins, increment on task completion
4. **Planning logic** — server detects when huddle should trigger, generates
   petition based on scrap/knowledge/history
5. **Petition message** — server sends proposed plan to client
6. **Fund/deny messages** — client sends approval, server validates coins,
   starts build

### Phase 2 — Build + Deploy (client-heavy)

7. **Build phase visuals** — agents gather at desk, progress bar, interrupt on
   task assignment
8. **`RobotNPC` class** — entity in `WorldLayer` with tier-based stats
9. **Robot sprite generation** — 4 tier designs in `textures.ts`
10. **Robot AI** — explore/hunt/collect/retreat state machine
11. **Robot spawning** — at office door, linked to agent

### Phase 3 — Combat + Treasure

12. **Robot combat** — `robot.takeDamage()`, calls `creature.takeDamage()`
13. **Creature targeting extension** — creatures can target robots if player
    isn't closer
14. **Treasure tiles** — new `TILE` entries, worldgen placement, robot
    collection
15. **Robot return/destruction** — loot delivery at door, agent reactions

### Phase 4 — Social + Polish

16. **Agent dialogue** — contextual lines based on expedition state
17. **Feed integration** — agents post about planning/building/deploying/
    recovering
18. **Minimap integration** — robots as green dots
19. **Achievements** — activate Coming Soon ones, add new ones
20. **Knowledge system** — track points, unlock tiers/recommendations
21. **Petition UI** — small panel/modal for approve/deny/downgrade

### Phase 5 — Expedition Workshop (Break Room Transformation)

22. **War table** — new furniture tile, huddle redirect from water cooler,
    holographic projection of proposed expedition
23. **Coin funding terminal** — wall-mounted interactable, replaces petition
    modal with physical E-interaction
24. **Scrap recycling bin** — visual scrap pool indicator, agent toss
    animation on task completion
25. **Robot workbench** — build phase relocates here, build VFX + progress
    bar, agent builder gathering
26. **Parts rack** — tier-locked component shelves, knowledge-gated
    visibility, E-browse interaction
27. **Charging dock** — robot return bay, loot unload VFX, signal-lost
    indicator on destruction
28. **Telemetry radio** — live deployment readout, audio cues for
    launch/death/return, agent clustering
29. **Research station** — post-expedition knowledge processing animation,
    E-interaction for knowledge level and unlocks
30. **Specimen shelves** — creature samples, crystal fragments, biome
    terrain jars, robot nameplates (fed by `ExpeditionRecord`)
31. **Biome map wall** — wall-mounted cartography, route/death/treasure
    markers, E-interaction for expedition history overlay
32. **Workshop furniture textures** — all new pieces via CanvasTexture in
    `furniture.ts`, registered in `upgradeFurniture()`
33. **Workshop interactables** — all new E-press handlers in
    `setupInteractables()` / `tryInteract()` in `scene.ts`

## 16. The Expedition Workshop

The break room (bottom-right of the office, roughly x=20–28, y=11–17)
transforms from a post-task chill zone into the **Expedition Workshop** — a
single room with three functional zones that map to the three phases of the
expedition loop. It's a laboratory, an armory, and a factory rolled into one.

The existing break room furniture (sofa, water cooler, coffee machine, fridge,
vending machine, microwave, toaster, kitchen counter/sink) stays — agents still
take breaks here. But the room gains a second identity: it's where the agents'
side projects live. A startup within a startup, with a garage.

### 16.1 The Laboratory (Knowledge & Research)

The post-expedition analysis zone. This is where findings become
understanding.

#### Research station

A desk with a microscope/terminal where agents analyze what the robot brought
back. After each expedition, one of the builder agents walks to the research
station and "processes" the results — a short animation (3–5s) where they
hunch over the terminal, sparks of data fly, and knowledge points tick up.

- Press **E** to see current knowledge level, progress to next unlock, and
  what's been learned.
- Unlocks are revealed here first: "Excavator blueprints acquired — build
  them at the workbench."
- At higher knowledge levels, the station shows **biome intel** — hostility
  ratings, creature types, treasure density per biome (gathered from past
  expedition data).

#### Specimen shelves

A natural-history-museum vibe that grows with every expedition:

- **Creature samples** — mounted on small pins, labeled ("Forest Wolf —
  hostility 1, 30 HP").
- **Crystal fragments** — glowing on a shelf, dim glow that brightens as you
  collect more.
- **Biome terrain samples** — small jars of dirt/stone from each biome
  reached (first-time-only unlocks).
- **Robot nameplates** — memorial plaques: "Scout-1 — Reached the Void",
  "Ranger-2 — Lost in the Ruins." Mixed with the specimens.

The shelves visually fill up over time. A fresh office has empty shelves with
dust. A veteran office looks like a cramped field research station.

#### Biome map wall

A wall-mounted map that starts blank and fills in as expeditions explore:

- Each biome discovered adds a colored region to the map.
- Robot routes are drawn as dotted lines (fading over time).
- Death markers (small X's) show where robots were lost.
- Treasure markers (gold dots) show where loot was found.
- Press **E** for a detailed overlay — "3 expeditions to the Ruins, 2
  returns, 1 loss, 14 crystals recovered."

This is the **cartography** piece — the Labyrinth becomes known territory
through sacrifice.

---

### 16.2 The Armory (Construction & Customization)

The build phase anchor. Where robots are constructed, upgraded, and stored.

#### Robot workbench

The central piece. A heavy workbench with:

- **Parts laid out** — chassis, limbs, antenna, sensor dish — visible on the
  surface, varying by proposed tier.
- **Build progress** — sparks, welding VFX, progress bar above the bench
  during build phase.
- **2–3 agent builders** gathered around, playing work animations.
- **Interrupt visual** — if you assign a task to a builder, the half-built
  robot slumps, parts scatter, scrap is lost.

After the build completes, the robot sprite is "activated" on the workbench
before rolling to the door — a brief moment where you see your creation come
to life.

This replaces the current build phase location ("the desk closest to the
office door") with a dedicated workshop space.

#### Parts rack

Shelves behind the workbench showing available components:

- **Tier-locked** — Scout parts are always visible. Ranger parts appear at
  knowledge 1. Excavator parts at knowledge 3. Bruiser parts at knowledge 5.
- **Custom loadout components** (v2, per the knowledge unlocks) — armor
  plating, extended battery, treasure sensors, each with a distinct visual
  on the shelf.
- Press **E** to browse available upgrades and their scrap costs.

This makes the tier system *visible*. You can see what you've unlocked.
Empty slots tease future possibilities.

#### Charging dock

Where returned robots park:

- Robot rolls in from the door, navigates to the dock, parks.
- Agents gather, loot is unloaded (treasure icons pop out with spark VFX).
- Robot sits for 5–10s while agents celebrate, then dissolves.
- **Empty dock after a loss** — a faint signal-lost indicator (red blinking
  light, static on a small screen) persists until the next expedition.

The dock is the emotional bookend. Build at the workbench, return at the
dock. The loop is physical.

### 16.3 The Factory (Economy & Planning)

The logistics zone — where resources are managed and expeditions are
commissioned.

#### Scrap recycling bin

A physical bin that fills with debris as scrap accumulates:

- Agents toss scrap in after completing tasks (quick walk-by animation,
  debris arc into the bin).
- Fill level = scrap pool amount (visual tiers: empty → quarter → half →
  full → overflowing).
- Press **E** to see exact scrap count and which tiers are currently
  affordable.
- At high scrap, the bin overflows with extra debris on the floor around it.

#### Coin funding terminal

A wall-mounted terminal (ATM vibes) where:

- The petition appears when a huddle is ready.
- Shows: proposed tier, target biome, scrap cost, coin cost, expected
  rewards.
- Player presses **E** to approve (coin-drop sound + VFX) or walks away to
  deny.
- Shows current coin balance.
- **Downgrade option** — "Can't afford the Ranger? Press Q to fund a Scout
  instead."

This replaces a popup modal with a physical interaction. You walk to the
terminal to fund your agents' dream.

#### War table

The planning huddle anchor. A table with a holographic projection:

- When a huddle triggers, agents gather around the war table (not the water
  cooler).
- A mini Labyrinth map projects above the table showing:
  - Proposed route (dotted line from office to target biome).
  - Robot tier preview (small sprite hovering above the table).
  - Risk indicators (creature icons along the route).
  - Treasure estimates (gold dots at the destination).
- The projection color matches the lead agent's accent color.
- After approve/deny, the projection fades, agents disperse.

The war table is the **decision point**. Everything in the factory zone
feeds into it — scrap from the bin, coins from the terminal, knowledge from
the lab, parts from the armory.

#### Telemetry radio

A vintage radio/terminal mounted on the wall near the war table:

- Silent when no robot is deployed.
- Crackles to life when a robot launches (audio cue — static, then signal
  lock).
- Live readout: distance, biome, HP, loot count, AI state.
- Agents cluster around it during deployment, reacting to events.
- Signal cuts to static on robot death (visceral audio moment).
- Victory jingle on successful return.

### 16.4 How the Room Flows

The expedition loop becomes a physical journey through the room:

```
Factory: Huddle at War Table → Approve at Coin Terminal
    │
    ▼
Armory: Agents gather at Workbench → Build robot → Robot activates
    │
    ▼
Factory: Robot rolls out → Telemetry Radio crackles to life
    │
    ▼
(monitoring phase — agents cluster around radio)
    │
    ├──► Robot returns → rolls to Charging Dock → loot unloaded
    │         │
    │         ▼
    │    Laboratory: Agent processes findings at Research Station
    │         │
    │         ▼
    │    Laboratory: Specimen shelves update, biome map updates
    │         │
    │         ▼
    │    Factory: Scrap bin fills with converted treasure
    │
    └──► Robot destroyed → Radio goes static → Dock sits empty
              │
              ▼
         Laboratory: Death marker on biome map, nameplate on shelf
              │
              ▼
         Factory: Agents grumble at war table, plan revenge expedition
```

Every expedition is a **walk through the room** — plan at the table, build at
the bench, monitor at the radio, return at the dock, analyze at the station,
remember on the shelves. The room *is* the loop.

### 16.5 Visual Evolution

The room visually transforms as the office gains expedition experience:

| Stage | Look |
|---|---|
| Fresh office | Empty shelves, blank map, dim radio, clean workbench, empty dock |
| 5 expeditions | A few specimens, partial map, radio has signal logs, workbench has tool marks |
| 20 expeditions | Shelves filling, map shows multiple biomes, dock has wear marks, parts rack has unlocked tiers |
| 50 expeditions | Museum-grade specimen wall, full biome map with routes, overflowing scrap bin, workbench is a veteran build station, nameplates line the wall |

A new player walks in and sees an empty workshop. A veteran player walks in
and sees a **laboratory of exploration history**. The room tells the story.

### 16.6 Tying Into Existing Systems

| Existing component | How it connects |
|---|---|
| `BREAK_SPOTS` in `agent.ts` | Agents already walk here post-task — redirect to scrap bin toss |
| `AgentNPC.huddle()` | Huddle now targets the war table instead of water cooler |
| `ExpeditionState` (scrap, knowledge, history) | All visualized physically in the room |
| `ExpeditionRecord` | Feeds specimen shelves, biome map, nameplates |
| `PERSONALITIES` in `manager.ts` | Docs Bard writes dramatic field reports at the research station; Code Gremlin obsesses over the parts rack |
| Feed system | Agent posts come from physical positions in the room ("Mocha is analyzing samples at the research station") |
| `VFXManager` | sparkBurst for scrap toss, celebrate for robot return, shockwave for build completion |
| Filing cabinet interaction pattern | Reused for research station, specimen shelf, biome map E-interactions |
| Trophy case rendering in `scene.ts` | Extended to specimen shelves and nameplate wall |
| `upgradeFurniture()` in `furniture.ts` | New workshop furniture textures generated via CanvasTexture |
| `setupInteractables()` in `scene.ts` | New interactable tiles registered for E-press handling |

## 17. Future Ideas (Not v1)

- **Two-bot expeditions** — send a Scout + Bruiser together
- **Custom robot loadouts** — spend extra scrap on armor plating, extended
  battery, treasure sensors
- **Robot naming** — agents name their robots (personality-driven)
- **Inter-office robot races** — multiplayer tie-in
- **Robot salvage** — send a robot to recover a destroyed robot's parts for
  partial scrap refund
- **Expedition logs** — readable filing cabinet entries with full mission
  reports written by the agents
