# Agent Heights

A virtual office where you hire and manage **real AI agents**. Each employee at a desk is a live coding agent that actually reads, writes, and runs code in its own workspace folder while you watch it work from a top-down Phaser office.

Hire an agent, give it a name, type a task, and watch it walk to its desk and start typing. Speech bubbles and the office feed stream its real tool calls and output in real time.

## How it works

```
┌─────────────────────┐        WebSocket         ┌──────────────────────┐
│  Client (Phaser 3)  │ ◄──── ws://:3001 ─────►  │  Server (Node + ws)  │
│  office scene, HUD  │                          │  AgentManager        │
└─────────────────────┘                          │   └─ Agent runner ──┼──► LLM API
                                                 └──────────┬───────────┘
                                                            │ each agent works in
                                                            ▼
                                                 ag/workspace/<name>-<id>/
```

- The **client** is a Phaser 3 game served by Vite. It renders the office, animates agents between their desks, and shows a HUD for hiring, assigning tasks, and reading per-agent logs.
- The **server** is a Node WebSocket server (`ws://localhost:3001`). It owns all state: the roster, per-agent logs, and the running SDK sessions.
- All game data lives in one folder: `ag/`. Each hired agent gets its own sandbox directory under `ag/workspace/` — tasks run there; agents can create files, run shell commands, and search the web, but are instructed to stay inside their folder.
- State persists across restarts: the full roster and every agent message are saved to `ag/save.json` (the single save file the server reloads on boot), and each play session gets a JSON transcript in `ag/logs/`. If the server restarts mid-task, agents come back idle with a note in their log.

## Features

- **Hire as many agents as you want** — the first 8 get desks, the rest work standing. Each gets a name, a random job title (Code Gremlin, Bug Whisperer, Refactor Goblin…), a sprite, and an optional custom system prompt set at hire time.
- **Persistent memory** — each agent is one continuous conversation with message history, resumed on every task, so it remembers every order you've given it and everything it did, across server restarts.
- **Assign tasks** to one agent or broadcast the same task to everyone who's free ("ASSIGN TO ALL").
- **Live activity feed** — assistant text, tool calls, results, and errors stream into the office feed and per-agent log panels.
- **Stop and fire** — abort a running task, or remove an agent entirely (their desk frees up).
- **Status lifecycle**: `idle → thinking → working → done / error`, reflected in the game world.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
- A `DEEPSEEK_KEY` in your environment / `.env` (see `.env.example` for all variables)

## Getting started

```bash
pnpm install

# (optional) regenerate the pixel-art tileset and character sprites
pnpm assets

# start the agent server and the Vite client together
pnpm dev
```

Then open **http://localhost:5173**. On first launch you'll name yourself and your office, then hit **+ HIRE AGENT** to bring on your first employee.

### Scripts

| Command          | What it does                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`       | Runs the WebSocket server (`tsx watch`) and Vite client concurrently |

| `pnpm client`    | Runs only the Vite dev server on port 5173                           |
| `pnpm build`     | Builds the client into `dist/`                                       |
| `pnpm assets`    | Regenerates sprites/tilesets into `client/public/assets/`            |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Type-checks the whole project with `tsc --noEmit`                    |

## Configuration

| Variable                | Default | Purpose                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DEEPSEEK_KEY`          | —       | DeepSeek API key (primary LLM provider, required)                                                          |
| `KIMI_KEY`              | —       | Kimi/Moonshot API key (vision provider, optional)                                                          |
| `SUPABASE_URL`          | —       | Cloud Supabase URL (enables auth + persistence)                                                            |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | —   | Supabase service role key (server-side, bypasses RLS)                                                      |

> ⚠️ **Security note:** agents can run shell commands inside their workspace folder. The workspace folder is a *convention* enforced by prompt (`cwd` + instructions), not an OS sandbox. Treat `ag/workspace/` as untrusted output, and disable auto-approve in Settings if you want manual confirmation before each command.

```

### Adding a provider

Providers are pluggable. Implement the `ProviderRunner` signature from `server/providers/types.ts` — an async generator that takes a task plus run context (`cwd`, `model`, `systemPrompt`, `abort`) and yields `TaskEvent`s (`text` | `tool` | `result` | `error`) — then wire it into the runner selection in `server/manager.ts` and add its models to `shared/types.ts`.

## Database

All persistent state lives in a cloud Supabase (Postgres) instance. The project is pre-linked via `supabase link`.

```bash
# Query the production DB
npx supabase db query "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.api_usage_records" --linked
```

See [docs/DATABASE.md](docs/DATABASE.md) for the full guide — table reference, common queries, and pitfalls to avoid.
