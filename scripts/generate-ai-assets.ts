/**
 * AI Asset Pipeline for Agent Heights.
 *
 * Generates tileable PBR surface textures using fal.ai PATINA Material.
 * Sprites, furniture, trees, and UI remain procedurally generated.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm tsx scripts/generate-ai-assets.ts                    # generate all
 *   pnpm tsx scripts/generate-ai-assets.ts --filter grass     # filter by name
 *   pnpm tsx scripts/generate-ai-assets.ts --tier 1           # only tier 1
 *   pnpm tsx scripts/generate-ai-assets.ts --dry-run          # list assets without generating
 *
 * Requires FAL_KEY environment variable.
 * Output: client/public/assets/ai/ + manifest.json
